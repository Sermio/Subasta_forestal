The Subasta Forestal application is an intuitive technology platform designed for those interested in buying or selling wood.

This application is aimed at both PROPERTY OWNERS (individuals and forestry communities) and BUYERS (self-employed individuals and companies).

After completing a simple registration, property owners can list the wood they wish to sell and receive offers from buyers already registered in the application. The auction will take place over a specified period, during which buyers will have the opportunity to make multiple offers. At the end of the process, the seller will contact the buyer who made the highest bid for the wood.
